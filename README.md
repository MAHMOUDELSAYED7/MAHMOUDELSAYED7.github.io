## Introduction
Qubic AI ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our chatbot app, Qubic AI, developed by Mahmoud El Sayed, available on Android and soon on iOS.

## Information We Do Not Collect
We do **not** collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, location, or payment details. All data generated through your use of the App, including chats and images, is stored **locally** on your device and is not transmitted to us, except as described below.

## Use of Google Generative AI
To provide chatbot functionality, the App sends your text queries to Google Generative AI (Gemini, via Google AI Studio) for processing. Only the text you input is sent to Google’s servers; no personal identifiers are included. Responses are stored locally on your device. Google’s use of query data is governed by their [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Local Data Storage
The App uses an **encrypted local database** on your device to store your chats and images, ensuring your data remains secure and accessible only to you.

## Data Security
We prioritize your data security. The local database employs **encryption** to protect your information from unauthorized access.

## Children’s Privacy
The App is suitable for children under 13. We comply with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** and **GDPR** requirements for children’s data. Since we do not collect personal information, no parental consent is required. Parents should note that user queries are sent to Google Generative AI as described above.

## Your Rights and Choices
You have full control over your data:
- **Delete Data**: You can delete locally stored chats and images through the App’s interface.
- **Notifications**: You can disable local notifications, scheduled every 8 hours via a worker, in the App’s settings.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. Changes will be reflected in an updated version within the App, with a revised effective date.
